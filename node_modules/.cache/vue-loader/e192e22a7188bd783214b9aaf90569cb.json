It is important that they feel safe and understood. This can be achieved by making sure the website does not convey the cold feeling\n                that is sometimes associated with the Law profession. This can be achieved in a number of ways.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"column is-6\">\n              <ul>\n                <li>\n                  A site that tells the story of why you are different.

It is integral that your website is made with the same level of professionalism as you would run the rest of your business. To achieve this\n            the focus will be on the following:\n          </p>\n          <ul>\n            <li>\n              <span class=\"secondary\">Modernise the design.</span> Use the width of the screen when it is there on desktop. Contrast, clean typography and space to breath.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              Add some\n              <span class=\"secondary\">colour</span> and\n              <span class=\"emphasis\">text hierarchy</span> to draw attention to the most important parts of each page.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              Introduce tasteful\n              <span class=\"secondary\">imagery</span> where appropriate.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              A level of\n              <span class=\"secondary\">polish</span> with subtle animation transitions between pages, and other small things that all come together to make the experience ‘feel’\n              better.\n            </li>\n          </ul>\n          <p>\n            Experience and expertise. The final area I want to focus on is showing a prospective client that you are the expert in the area they need assistance\n            in. We have already made some agreements of a few ways to make positive changes in this area. Adding articles that you have written is a\n            great way to show you are in touch with the issues people are having.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Being a newer firm, it’s not wise to go down the “3000 years helping people build campfires” route, but you can still sell yourself. Some of the\n            information written in the “About Us” section does a good job of this, and with the addition of Lawyer profiles and testimonials, I believe this will\n            make some great strides.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </transition>\n      <h1 @click=\"toggleSections\" id=\"1\" class=\"section-title\">\n        Wireframes\n        <i class=\"fas fa-level-down-alt\"></i>\n      </h1>\n      <transition name=\"fade\" mode=\"out-in\">\n        <div v-if=\"activeSections[1]\" class=\"content\">\n          <p>Keeping details to a bare minimum, wireframes were used to get a grasp of content structure and hierarchy.</p>\n          <div class=\"columns\">\n            <div class=\"column is-6\">\n              <img src=\"../assets/dcm-images/wireframes1.jpg\" alt=\"first wireframe image\">\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"column is-6\">\n              <img src=\"../assets/dcm-images/wireframes2.jpg\" alt=\"first wireframe image\">\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </transition>-->\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"columns is-mobile screenshots\">\n      <div class=\"column is-12\">\n        <img src=\"../assets/dcm-images/dcm-desktop.jpg\" alt=\"desktop layout for DCM Lawyers\">\n        <div class=\"columns is-mobile\">\n          <div class=\"column is-6\">\n                          <img\n              src=\"../assets/dcm-images/dcm-mobile-home-showcase.jpg\"\n              alt=\"mobile layout for DCM Lawyers home page\"\n            >\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"column is-6\">\n                          <img\n              src=\"../assets/dcm-images/dcm-family-law-mobile-showcase.jpg\"\n              alt=\"mobile layout for DCM Lawyers family law page\"\n            >\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\n// @ is an alias to /src\n\nexport default {\n  name: \"DcmLawyers\",\n  components: {},\n  data: function() {\n    return {\n      activeSections: { 0: false, 1: false, 2: false }\n    };\n  },\n  mounted() {},\n  methods: {\n    toggleSections(evt) {\n      let id = evt.target.id;\n      let that = this;\n      if (that.activeSections[id]) {\n        that.activeSections[id] = false;\n      } else {\n        that.activeSections[id] = true;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n};\n</script>\n\n<style lang=\"scss\" scoped>\n@import \"@/assets/scss/settings.scss\";\n\n.title {\n  color: $grey;\n  position: absolute;\n  .text {\n    position: relative;\n  }\n  h1 {\n    margin-top: 100px;\n    font-size: 1em;\n    font-weight: 700;\n  }\n  h3 {\n    color: $primary-colour;\n    font-weight: 700;\n    font-size: 24px;\n  }\n  h4 {\n    font-size: 0.8em;\n  }\n}\n.content {\n  color: $grey;\n  p,\n  ul {\n    padding: 10px;\n  }\n  ul {\n    margin-top: 0;\n  }\n  .content-section {\n    padding: 50px 0;\n  }\n  .features {\n    margin: 0;\n    li {\n      font-size: 14px;\n      //   color: $primary-colour;\n      font-weight: 700;\n      list-style: none;\n      letter-spacing: 0.05em;\n    }\n  }\n  .secondary {\n    color: $secondary-colour;\n    font-weight: 700;\n  }\n  .quote {\n    letter-spacing: 0.05em;\n    line-height: 1.7em;\n    color: #a9a9a9;\n    width: 75%;\n    text-align: center;\n    margin: 0 auto;\n    padding-left: 30px;\n    padding-right: 30px;\n  }\n  .emphasis {\n    color: $primary-colour;\n    font-weight: 700;\n  }\n}\n.highlight {\n  margin-top: 100px;\n  display: flex;\n  align-items: center;\n  flex-direction: column;\n  img {\n    width: 80%;\n  }\n  .btn-solid {\n    margin: 0 0 50px 0;\n    &:hover {\n      color: $secondary-colour;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n.section-title {\n  margin-top: 50px;\n  font-size: 2em;\n  color: $primary-colour;\n  font-weight: 700;\n  cursor: pointer;\n  transition: all 0.5s ease;\n  i {\n    font-size: 0.8em;\n    padding-left: 20px;\n  }\n}\n\n.screenshots {\n  margin-top: 100px;\n  padding: 0;\n  * {\n    padding: 0 !important;\n  }\n}\n\n.fade-enter-active,\n.fade-leave-active {\n  transition: opacity 0.4s ease-in-out, transform 0.4s ease-in-out;\n}\n.fade-enter,\n.fade-leave-to {\n  opacity: 0;\n}\n</style>\n\n"]}]}
