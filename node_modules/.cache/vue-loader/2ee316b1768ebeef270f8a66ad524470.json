As a firm involved heavily in family law, they were in need of higher level of connection with their users to increase website conversion and a more modern and professional presentation of themselves. They were also looking for more control of their own content than their previous providers were giving them.</p>\n      <p>\n        I developed them a custom\n        <span class=\"emphasis\">WordPress</span> theme with full customisation of content.

It is important that they feel safe and understood. This can be achieved by making sure the website does not convey the cold feeling\n              that is sometimes associated with the Law profession. This can be achieved in a number of ways.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"column is-6\">\n            <ul>\n              <li>\n                A site that tells the story of why you are different. Compassionate, supportive and approachable. A user should feel like they have a feel for\n                the type of firm you are just from browsing your site.\n              </li>\n              <li>For this part of trust, it is important to come off as people helping people.</li>\n              <li>A colour palette on the warmer side.</li>\n              <li>Photos and profiles of the Lawyers. Seeing a face can make a large difference to feeling safer.</li>\n              <li>Testimonials of people who were pleased with how they were treated.</li>\n            </ul>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>\n          <span class=\"emphasis\">PROFESSIONALISM.</span>\n          Right or wrong, more and more people will judge the capability of a company based on the visual appeal and usability of their\n          website. It is integral that your website is made with the same level of professionalism as you would run the rest of your business. To achieve this\n          the focus will be on the following:\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            <span class=\"secondary\">Modernise the design.</span> Use the width of the screen when it is there on desktop. Contrast, clean typography and space to breath.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Add some\n            <span class=\"secondary\">colour</span> and\n            <span class=\"emphasis\">text hierarchy</span> to draw attention to the most important parts of each page.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Introduce tasteful\n            <span class=\"secondary\">imagery</span> where appropriate.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            A level of\n            <span class=\"secondary\">polish</span> with subtle animation transitions between pages, and other small things that all come together to make the experience ‘feel’\n            better.\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>\n          Experience and expertise. The final area I want to focus on is showing a prospective client that you are the expert in the area they need assistance\n          in. We have already made some agreements of a few ways to make positive changes in this area. Adding articles that you have written is a\n          great way to show you are in touch with the issues people are having.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Being a newer firm, it’s not wise to go down the “3000 years helping people build campfires” route, but you can still sell yourself. Some of the\n          information written in the “About Us” section does a good job of this, and with the addition of Lawyer profiles and testimonials, I believe this will\n          make some great strides.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </transition>\n    <h1 @click=\"toggleSections\" id=\"1\" class=\"section-title\">\n      Wireframes\n      <i class=\"fas fa-level-down-alt\"></i>\n    </h1>\n    <transition name=\"fade\" mode=\"out-in\">\n      <div v-if=\"activeSections[1]\" class=\"content\">\n        <p>Keeping details to a bare minimum, wireframes were used to get a grasp of content structure and hierarchy.</p>\n        <div class=\"columns\">\n          <div class=\"column is-6\">\n            <img src=\"../assets/dcm-images/wireframes1.jpg\" alt=\"first wireframe image\">\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"column is-6\">\n            <img src=\"../assets/dcm-images/wireframes2.jpg\" alt=\"first wireframe image\">\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </transition>-->\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"columns is-mobile screenshots\">\n    <div class=\"column is-12\">\n      <img src=\"../assets/dcm-images/dcm-desktop.jpg\" alt=\"desktop layout for DCM Lawyers\">\n      <div class=\"columns is-mobile\">\n        <div class=\"column is-6\">\n                        <img\n            src=\"../assets/dcm-images/dcm-mobile-home-showcase.jpg\"\n            alt=\"mobile layout for DCM Lawyers home page\"\n          >\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"column is-6\">\n                        <img\n            src=\"../assets/dcm-images/dcm-family-law-mobile-showcase.jpg\"\n            alt=\"mobile layout for DCM Lawyers family law page\"\n          >\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n",null]}
